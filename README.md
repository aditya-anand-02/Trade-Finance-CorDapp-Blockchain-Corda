Business Context: Trade finance signifies financing for trade, and it concerns both domestic and international trade transactions. A trade transaction requires a seller of goods and services as well as a buyer. Various intermediaries such as banks and financial institutions can facilitate these transactions by financing the trade.

Trade finance is the process by which sellers (exporters) and buyers (importers) mitigate trade risk through the use of trusted intermediaries.

 

Problem Statement: Can we have a global trade platform which eliminates application/community silos in current trade process and provides trust and transparency.

Platform should be able to reduce delayed timelines and payments process optimizations in current international trade.

 

Functional Flow: Blockchain technology offers a potential medium to exchange assets without centralized trusts or intermediaries, and without the risk of double spending. The tamper-proof nature of the blocks eliminates the possibility of fraud. This technology could also address operational risk through transparency and immutability, thus significantly helping banks reduce their operational costs when executing controls.
